# What is JavaScript?

“Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster.” –
Jeremy Keith, 2009

Inconsistent behaviour - JS "looking" code not defined in ES spec can also be valid JS (Eg. `alert` and `console.log`) with valid JS syntax and behaviours, but its handling is dependent on the environment running the JS engine. This results in inconsistent behaviour across browsers. These are usually JS-looking APIs/built-in modules in the web environment, which are not part of the official spec but is considered to be JavaScript

Gotchas in Devtools - Focuses on fast and easy results for devs, focused on developer experience and not on strictly correct way to compile JS.

JS is a multi-paradigm language - up to the developer to choose procedural, class, or functional programming style of code.

JavaScript is founded on the principle of "backwards compatibility". Code once accepted in the ES specification will never become invalid. This makes JS a safe bet to build things. JS is NOT forwards compatible. Forwards compatible is "including a new addition to the language in a program would not cause that program to break if it were run in an older JS engine." HTML and CSS are forwards compatible but not backwards compatible.
Solution to this: transpiling. Transpilers like Babel convert new JS syntax versions to an equivalent older versions, so programs written in newer syntax don't crash in environments running old JS versions.
If forwards compatibility issues are related to missing API methods and not new syntax, the solution is to define that API method that fits in the older environment like its natively defined, aka, a polyfill, aka aka "shim". This is also done by transpilers most of the time.

Strict mode - Back in 2009 with the release of ES5, JS added strict mode as an opt-in mechanism for encouraging better JS programs.. Most strict mode controls are in the form of early errors, meaning errors that aren't strictly syntax errors but are still thrown at compile time.  strict mode is like a linter reminding you how JS should be written to have the highest quality and best chance at performance. If you find yourself feeling handcuffed, trying to work around strict mode, that should be a blaring red warning flag that you need to back up and rethink the whole approach.

Defined

JS is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard (version ES2019 as of this writing), which is guided by the TC39 committee and hosted by ECMA. It runs in browsers and other JS environments such as Node.js.

JS is a multi-paradigm language, meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP).

JS is a compiled language, meaning the tools (including the JS engine) process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.

## Programming Primer (in JS)

### Values

```javascript
//Primitive

42
3.14

"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya"

true
false

null
undefined

//Non-primitive

{ name: "Inigo Montoya", profession: "Vengeance"}

[ 1, 2, 3 ]
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
[{ name: "Tony Stark", supeName: "Iron Man"}, { name: "Steve Rogers", supeName: "Captain America" }]
[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]]

```
### Operations

```javascript
400 + 20
70 - 1

"Ban" + "ana"
"20" + "20"

!false //Single operands, unary operators
!null
!undefined

"20" == 20 //Loose equality (No type checking)
"20" === 20 //Strict equality (Type coercion)
20.0 == 20
20.0 < 20

null || true
true && undefined
!undefined && !null
```

### Variables

"Kind of" value is the type of the value

`typeof` operator

```js
typeof 42                                                //number

typeof "Inigo Montoya"                                   //string

typeof true                                              //boolean

typeof undefined                                         //undefined

typeof { name: "Inigo Montoya", profession: "Vengeance"} //object

typeof null                                              //object
typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ]                                       //object
```

Variables points to representation in memory

`console` also a memory, `console.log` accesses `log` method of `console` objects

`()` groups things together, also acts as a function call if succeeding a variable
```js

var fruit = "apple"

var veggie;
veggie = "banana"

var moreFruits = [ "grapes", "watermelons", "pineapple" ]

console.log(moreFruits.length)
console.log(moreFruits[1])
```

Operations with variables

```js

var temperature = 30

temperature+= 11
temperature++

console.log(temperature)
```

### Expressions and Statements

```js
var temperature = 30; //statement

temperature = (temperature * 2) - 18 //expression (Fun fact: 6 expressions on this line)
```


### Decisions
`if/else` controls decisions
```js
var craving = "coffee"

if(craving === "coffee") {
    makeCoffee();
}

if(isCoffeeThere()) {
    haveCoffee()
} else {
    makeCoffee()
}
```
### Loops

Several grouped operations done multiple times.
`for` loop repeats something `n` number of times
```js
var fruits = [ "apples", "grapes", "watermelons", "pineapple" ]

for(let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) { //declare a "counter" that counts the number of loops, specify the stopping condition, and how the counter should be modified after every loop
    eatFruit(fruits[i])
}

for (let fruit of fruits) { //Decalare iterator that goes through the iterator group
    eatFruitAgain(fruit[i])
}

while (fruits.length > 0) {
    let fruit = fruits.pop()
    eatFruit(fruit)
}
```

### Functions
Function = Collection of code that can be done many times at different places.

```js

function eatFruit(fruit) {
    console.log(`Had ${fruit}`) //`` is an interpolated string (similar to a template)
}

function giveFruit(fruit) {
    return `Fruit given ${fruit}`
}

var getFruit = giveFruit("Apple")
console.log(getFruit) // "Fruit given Apple"
```

### Programming Primer Exercise

```js
// TODO: define addFavoriteBook(..) function

// TODO: define printFavoriteBooks() function

var favoriteBooks = [];

addFavoriteBook("A Song of Ice and Fire");
addFavoriteBook("The Great Gatsby");
addFavoriteBook("Crime & Punishment");
addFavoriteBook("Great Expectations");
addFavoriteBook("You Don't Know JS");

// TODO: print out favorite books

```
